## Description

To create my portfolio I used a React application to design a website portfolio to showcase my work to future employers. It includes a section about me, a section with links to my projects, and a section with my contact info. I created a link to my resume, Git Hub, and LinkedIn website. I used Chakra UI components to style my website, make it mobile responsive, and to style the states of different elements.
